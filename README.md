# King Edward VI School Student Robotics 2024
Welcome to the heart of the King Edward VI Student Robotics 2024 team! This is where code will be stored and managed, and you can contribute to it relatively easily. <br /><br />
If you want to work on the code yourself, you'll first need to make a GitHub account. Then, go to the repository and make a branch. Make your changes, push them to your branch, and make a pull request to Max or Alex (max-sepp or penumbra-0000). They should get back to you soon enough and boom, there's your code.
Make sure Max or Alex know who you are; feel free to give one of them your GitHub username in school so they know who's who.<br /><br />
If anyone wants a crash course in how to contribute, email Alex (standard school email) and he'll give you some tips on how to get set up.
